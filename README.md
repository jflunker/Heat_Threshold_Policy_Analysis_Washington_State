# Heat_Threshold_Policy_Analysis_Washington_State
# This repo is designed to provide reproducible code used to visualize variability in PRISM meteorological data and heat threshold exceedances at the county level throughout the state of Washington (https://prism.oregonstate.edu/)
# Refer to .R code files to generate tables and state visualizations. Follow R code files in chronological ascending order, starting with 1 (1_extract.R) and ending with 8 (8_make_table_threshold_mean_sd.R). Ensure working directory is set correctly in code for 1_extract.R.
# All required data and shape files are contained in this repository yet can also be downloaded directly from the source. See comments in each .R code file and PRISM_data.docx for how to download the data directly.
