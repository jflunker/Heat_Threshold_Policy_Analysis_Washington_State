# Heat_Threshold_Policy_Analysis_Washington_State
# This repository is designed to provide reproducible code used to visualize variability in PRISM meteorological data and heat threshold exceedances at the county level throughout the state of Washington (PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State University, https://prism.oregonstate.edu).
# Refer to .R code files to generate tables and state visualizations. 
# All required shape files for generating WA state maps are contained in this repository yet can also be downloaded directly from the source. See comments in each .R code file for how to download the data directly.
# All required PRISM weather data must be downloaded directy from the PRISM website https://prism.oregonstate.edu) following the directions in the document, PRISM_data.docx, which is found in this repository. Alternatively, the R data files used to generate tables and figures based on the PRISM data can be found in this respository in the folder "3_within_R_data_files_PRISM_Summary".
